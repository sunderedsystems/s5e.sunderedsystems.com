# Ability Score Increase

- At every **even-numbered level** (including 20), gain 1 ability point.
- **Scores can rise above 20** after creation, but every point above 20 must be offset by subtracting 1 from another score.

**Example:**  
If you have Knowledge 20 and Influence 13, and raise Knowledge to 21, lower Influence to 12 (or another stat by 1).
