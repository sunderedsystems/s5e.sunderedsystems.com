# Actions and Control (Summons)

Summoned creatures have a limited degree of autonomy:

- They can identify allies and enemies according to their summoner's knowledge, attack known threats, and defend their summoner or companions.
- They may act on summoner intent—such as moving to a specified location, attacking a chosen target, or interacting with the environment—using their movement to do so

## Core Action: Command

- Spend one Core Action: Command (or equivalent) to direct a group (group = 50ft movement pool) or an individual (may act multiple times using their movement/SD under a single command).
- Unlike pets or familiars, one Core Action: Command utilizes all summons’ abilities.

## Adjusting SD After Summoning

-You may add or remove SD from one summoned creature after it has been summoned by spending a Core Action or equivalent.


-Whenever you add or remove SD, the summon’s HP is adjusted immediately to reflect the new total.

Example: You add 2 SD (with a d8 summoning die) to a summon that already had 3 SD committed. The summon’s HP increases by 16 (2 SD × 8).
