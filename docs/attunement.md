# Attunement

To harness a magical item’s Source, a player must attune to it:

- **Attunement Time:**  
  Takes a number of days equal to the item’s maximum SD.  
  For each day of attunement, the player gains access to +1 SD from the item.

- **Attunement Limit:**  
  A character can be attuned to magical items with a combined total SD no greater than their base SD (before bonuses, items, or temporary effects).
