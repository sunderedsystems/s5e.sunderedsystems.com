# Barbarian

Classes define your unique strengths.

When multi-classing under level 20, players gain the core feature of a second class at level 10 in that class.

In Ascended play (beyond level 20) a character gains the core feature of any new class they take at level 20 in that class.

## Core Features

### Frenzy

Can’t die while raging. If reduced to 0 HP, subsequent damage taken removes 1 SD. Rage ends after encounter or when SD is empty.

### Rage

Spend 2 SD (or equivalent) to enter Rage at any time and gain access to barbarian abilities.

- While raging, you cannot cast concentration spells, and all other spellcasting is rolled with disadvantage (roll 2d20, use lower roll).
- Rage ends when you:
    - Choose to cancel it (may be done at any time),
    - Run out of Source Dice,
    - Or have not taken damage or made an attack for 1 minute.
 
### Natural Born Fighter

- You gain an extra fighting style. It does not count against your talents.
 
## Class Talents and Fighting Styles

- Start with 2 talents at level 1.
- Gain more talents equal to your proficiency each time proficiency increases.
- May reassign 2 talents each time proficiency increases (or every 5 levels after level 20)

## Fighting Styles

Any class may pick a Fighting Style instead of a class talent. You cannot take the same Fighting Style more than once.

**Options:**

- **Ranged:** Increase ranged weapon range by 10ft per proficiency.
- **Defense:** While wearing armor, decrease damage by proficiency an extra time.
- **Dueling:** One-handed weapon + empty offhand—add damage equal to SD spent on attack.
- **Great Weapon Fighting:** When rolling 1 or 2 on a damage die for a two-handed melee weapon, reroll (must use new roll). Weapon must be two-handed or versatile.
- **Protection:** If a creature within 5ft is attacked, you can block for them.
- **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When using two weapons, may use Sleight of Hand vs. Agility for your second attack; on success, disarm or make the target drop an item.
