#### Anima channel (requires rage)
You are the vessel of raw elements and ancestral spirits. Your rage is not mindless, it is a ritual. A communion. You blend fury and blood to channel the primal forces of the world using your vitality. You gain the ability to focus your fury into spells. You may cast spells or concentrate while raging; however, each spell cast deals damage to you equal to your proficiency. While concentrating, lose HP equal to your proficiency each round for each spell you are concentrating on.

#### Anima Wrath (requires Anima Channel)
