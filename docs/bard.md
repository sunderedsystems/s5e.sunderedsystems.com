# Bard

## Core Features

Classes define your unique strengths.

When multi-classing under level 20, players gain the core feature of a second class at level 10 in that class.

In Ascended play (beyond level 20), a character gains the core feature of any new class they take at level 20 in that class.

### Inspiration

    The bard has a pool of inspiration equal to their proficiency (and cannot exceed this maximum)
    This pool of inspiration recharges at the same rate as Source.
    Spend one inspiration to impose advantage or disadvantage on one check they can see or hear within 60ft, or
    Grant inspiration to a target within 60ft
    A target's granted inspiration cannot receive another until they have used their current inspiration.


## Class Talents and Fighting Styles

    Start with 2 talents at level 1.
    Gain more talents equal to your proficiency each time proficiency increases.
    May reassign 2 talents each time proficiency increases (or every 5 levels after level 20)

Fighting Styles

Any class may pick a Fighting Style instead of a class talent. You cannot take the same Fighting Style more than once.

Options:

    Ranged: Increase ranged weapon range by 10ft per proficiency.
    Defense: While wearing armor, decrease damage by proficiency an extra time.
    Dueling: One-handed weapon + empty offhand—add damage equal to SD spent on attack.
    Great Weapon Fighting: When rolling 1 or 2 on a damage die for a two-handed melee weapon, reroll (must use new roll). Weapon must be two-handed or versatile.
    Protection: If a creature within 5ft is attacked, you can block for them.
    Two-Weapon Fighting: When using two weapons, may use Sleight of Hand vs. Agility for your second attack; on success, disarm or make the target drop an item.

#### Fascinate (CA)
The bard can use their performance to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated. A fascinated creature adds the bard’s proficiency to the difficulty of perception checks not targeting the bard’s performance. A target must be within 50 feet, able to see or hear the bard, and capable of paying attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creatures affected. Any obvious threat to the creatures will end or prevent the fascinated effect. This can affect a number of creatures equal SD spent on this ability, a minimum of one. Requires concentration.

#### Encourage (CA)
The bard can use their performance to grant courage to themself and a number of willing allies equal to the SD spent on this ability. A target must be within 30ft, able to see or hear the bard, and if affected, adds the bard's spell casting modifier to combat checks while the song lasts. Requires concentration.

#### Dirge of Doom (CA)
The bard can use their performance to strike fear into those affected. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and able to see or hear the bard’s performance. Affected targets increase the difficulty of their ability checks by the bard’s proficiency. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and the bard continues the performance. If the performance targets a creature below half of their hit points, the creature becomes frightened and flees if able. If an affected creature witnesses or becomes aware of an ally’s death, the creature becomes panicked. This can affect a number of creatures equal to the SD spent on this ability, a minimum of one. Requires concentration. This ability targets a creature’s wisdom.

---

#### Sooth (CA)
The bard can use their performance to heal and ease a number of conditions. This performance removes the fatigued, sickened, and shaken condition from all those affected. Using this ability requires 2 rounds of continuous performance, and the targets must be able to see or hear the bard throughout the performance. This can affect a number of creatures equal to the SD spent on this ability, a minimum of one. Requires concentration. This ability targets a creature’s wisdom.

---

#### Killer Show (CA)
The bard can use their performance to severely stress those affected, causing them to lose hit points. A target must be within 30 feet and able to see or hear the bard. This performance targets a creature’s constitution. If affected, a creature loses hit points equal to the bard’s spellcasting modifier plus proficiency every time they end their turn within range of the performance. Increase the range of this performance or the amount of damage caused (or both) by increasing the amount of SD spent.
