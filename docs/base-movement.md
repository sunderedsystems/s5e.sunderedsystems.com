# Base Movement

- All player characters occupy the size “Humanoid,” regardless of dimensions.
- Creatures under 4ft tall: base movement 40ft.
- Creatures over 6ft tall: +10ft movement for every 12 inches above 6ft. Their Agility score decreases by 1 due to size and bulk.
- Creatures larger than “Humanoid” are targeted by Constitution instead of Agility.
