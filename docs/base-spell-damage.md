# Base Spell Damage

When you cast a spell that deals damage, the Source Dice (SD) spent to cast the base spell are included in the damage pool.

- The base spell refers to the spell as written — without any additional SD spent to enhance it.
- Base damage for a damaging spell is:  
  Spellcasting Modifier + Proficiency (if proficient) + SD spent to cast (equal to spell’s level).

Example 1: A cantrip costs a Core Action. Its base damage is Spellcasting Modifier + Proficiency (if proficient)

Example 2: Fireball (level 3), Knowledge 18 (+4), Proficiency +2 = 4 + 2 + 3SD rolled for damage.
