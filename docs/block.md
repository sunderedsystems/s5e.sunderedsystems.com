# Block

You may block incoming damage by committing Source Dice (SD) (up to your proficiency, minimum 2SD), or by spending 20ft of unspent movement.

- Roll the committed SD
- Add the result to your base absorption (Strength modifier + proficiency, if proficient).
- Reduce the incoming damage by that total.
- Magic damage may only be blocked using magical weapons or shields.
- Blocked spell damage stacks with mitigation like “mana shield”.

**Dig In:** Spend unspent movement to reduce incoming physical damage by –1 per 10ft spent.

**Example:**  
You’re being hit for 17 damage. You commit 3SD (roll: 10), your Strength mod is +3, proficiency is +3, and you Dig In with 20ft movement (–2).  
Total absorbed: 10 (SD) + 3 (Str) + 3 (Prof) + 2 (Dig In) = 18.  
The attack deals 0 damage (any excess absorption is lost).
