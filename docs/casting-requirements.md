# Casting Requirements

- Casting a spell requires either verbal or somatic components unless you have a spell focus or feature that removes this requirement.
- Spell focuses remove the need for verbal or somatic components.

- Casting a spell costs a Core Action and SD equal to the spellâ€™s level, or a combination of converted costs like 3SD for a level one spell, or 30ft of movement speed.

- Casting a spell that exceeds your proficiency in level is a strained action (see: Stress & Strain).

- Only spells with a designated level (like Misty Step, 3rd level) count toward the proficiency cap.

- Spells do not gain levels by scaling.
