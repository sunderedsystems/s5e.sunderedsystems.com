# Channeled Abilities

Channeled Abilities draw from internal force, discipline, or spiritual focus. Unlike spells, they do not require verbal or somatic components, and they do not involve casting checks.

These abilities may:

- Infuse attacks with elemental or mystical energy
- Activate passive or reactive auras
- Modify actions or techniques
