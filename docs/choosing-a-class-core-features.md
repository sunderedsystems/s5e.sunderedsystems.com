# Choosing a Class: Core Features

Classes define your unique strengths. The following are adapted from D&D 5e, streamlined for Sundered play.

---

### Barbarian: Frenzy

- Spend extra SD up to your Proficiency each turn while raging (does not bypass stress/strain effects of exceeding proficiency cap within a round)
- Can’t die while raging. If reduced to 0 HP, spend 1 SD per round to stay up. Rage ends after encounter or when SD is empty.

---

### Bard: Inspiration

- The bard has a number of inspiration equal to their proficiency. They can use one this inspiration to impose advantage or disadvantage on one check they can see within 60ft. This pool of inspiration recharges at the same rate as Source.

---

### Cleric: Supplement

- Using a Core Action/equivalent, Cleric can link their Source Pool to a number of targets equal to their proficiency, expanding their allies Source Pool.

---

### Druid

- Knows a number of shapes to shift in/out equal to proficiency. Requires a Core Action/equivalent but no DC.
