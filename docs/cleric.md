# Cleric

Classes define your unique strengths.

When multi-classing under level 20, players gain the core feature of a second class at level 10 in that class.

In Ascended play (beyond level 20) a character gains the core feature of any new class they take at level 20 in that class.

## Core Features

### Supplement

    Using a Core Action/equivalent, Cleric can link their Source Pool to a number of targets equal to their proficiency, expanding their allies Source Pool.

## Class Talents and Fighting Styles

    Start with 2 talents at level 1.
    Gain more talents equal to your proficiency each time proficiency increases.
    May reassign 2 talents each time proficiency increases (or every 5 levels after level 20)

### Fighting Styles

Any class may pick a Fighting Style instead of a class talent. You cannot take the same Fighting Style more than once.

Options:

    Ranged: Increase ranged weapon range by 10ft per proficiency.
    Defense: While wearing armor, decrease damage by proficiency an extra time.
    Dueling: One-handed weapon + empty offhand—add damage equal to SD spent on attack.
    Great Weapon Fighting: When rolling 1 or 2 on a damage die for a two-handed melee weapon, reroll (must use new roll). Weapon must be two-handed or versatile.
    Protection: If a creature within 5ft is attacked, you can block for them.
    Two-Weapon Fighting: When using two weapons, may use Sleight of Hand vs. Agility for your second attack; on success, disarm or make the target drop an item.


#### Domain: 

The cleric has on their person at all times the symbol of divinity according to their domain, through which they can cast or channel spells (this can be a tattoo or drawn symbol). The domains are Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War.

---

#### Disciple of Life

Cleric healing spells are empowered. Any creature healed by the cleric regains additional hit points equal to the number of SD/equivalent spent on the spell.

---

#### Twin Flames

The cleric can bind their vitality to another creature they can see within 30ft. While the bond is active, any damage either creature takes is split evenly between them (rounded down). The bond lasts a number of rounds equal to the cleric’s proficiency or until either creature falls unconscious. This ability can target an unwilling creature by making a spell check against the target’s influence. The cleric can only maintain one Twin Flames bond at a time.

---

#### Luminosity

The divine power the cleric channels lingers within them. Whenever the cleric casts a healing spell, they regain hit points equal to the number of SD spent on that spell.

---

#### Divine Strike

When the cleric deals damage with a successful melee or ranged weapon attack, they may alter the damage type to any damage type associated with their domain.

---

#### Turn Undead

As an action, the cleric presents their holy symbol and makes a spellcasting check against the highest Wisdom score among all undead creatures within 30ft. On a success, affected undead are feared for a number of rounds equal to the cleric’s proficiency. While feared, they must use all available movement and SD to flee from the cleric. If an affected undead cannot flee, it takes damage of a type chosen by the cleric from within their domain equal to the cleric’s proficiency at the start of every round it remains within 30ft of the cleric.
