# Concentration & Damage

If a creature takes damage while concentrating:

1. End the concentration spell(s)  **or**
2. Maintain concentration by succeeding on a stressed Constitution check.

- Stressed Check DC = 30 +1 (expended SD) â€“ (your Constitution score)
- If the check fails, all concentration effects end.
- If the check succeeds, you continue concentrating without interruption.
