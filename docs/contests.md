# Contests

When two creatures oppose each other directly, each makes an ability check.

- Both sides roll d20 + modifier (+ proficiency, if applicable).
- Source Dice (SD) may be committed before the roll, adding +1 per SD to the total.
- Highest result wins. Ties = stalemate, nothing changes.

**Social contests never use SD unless the outcome shifts the narrative, bypasses danger, or replaces combat.**

If the GM calls for SD, it should never cost more than 1 SD to attempt.

## When Social Checks Should Cost Source

- The outcome directly shifts a scene, changes NPC behavior, or bypasses real danger.
- Used in place of combat (e.g., intimidating surrender).
- Stakes are high.

## When Social Checks Should NOT Cost Source

- Flavor, banter, no real consequence on failure, or natural conversation.
