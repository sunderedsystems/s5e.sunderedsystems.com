# Core Actions

- Each turn, you get **one free Core Action** (CA).
- Core Actions include attacks, spellcasting, or any check requiring a d20 roll.
- Actions may cost 1 CA, or 1 CA plus extra SD for stronger effects.

**Equivalency:**  
1 Core Action = 2 SD = 20ft movement = (10ft movement + 1 SD)
