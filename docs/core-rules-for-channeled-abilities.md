# Core Rules for Channeled Abilities

- Do not count as spellcasting. Channeled abilities are distinct from spells and follow their own rules.
- Do not require concentration. You may maintain multiple channeled effects without penalty.
- Ignore spellcasting limitations. They do not impose or suffer from spellcasting penalties (e.g., no disadvantage while raging, and no need for components).
