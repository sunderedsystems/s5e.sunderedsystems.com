# Counter Attack

When a creature within 5ft of you attempts to leave your melee range, you may make a melee attack against them as a reaction.

**Cost Options (choose one):**
- 1 SD
- 10ft of unspent movement

SD spent this way counts toward your proficiency cap.

You cannot make multiple Counter Attacks against the same target in a single round unless an ability possessed specifically allows it.
