# Countering Spell Damage

To counter incoming spell damage:
- Commit SD equal to the spell’s level.
- Make a counter check vs. the spell’s total check value.
- If successful, counter the spell’s damaging effects.
- If the SD spent exceeds your proficiency cap, the counter becomes a strained action.
