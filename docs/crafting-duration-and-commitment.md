# Crafting Duration & Commitment

- To craft an item, a player must commit SD equal to the itemâ€™s final Source pool.
- Each 1 SD committed = 1 day of crafting.
- Multiple crafters can split the commitment, reducing the individual burden.
- If a single player completes the entire crafting process, they are fully attuned to the item upon completion.
