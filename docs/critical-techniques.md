# Critical Techniques

Critical techniques expand a character’s tactical combat efficacy, and count against total known techniques.

## 1. Acquisition

- Critical Techniques are included in your total known techniques.
- Knowing more critical techniques gives you broader choices for effects.

## 2. Application

**Critical Damage Bank (CDB):**  
Whenever you land a melee or spell hit that deals damage, you may bank crit damage in your CDB equal to your proficiency. This banking resolves before the hit applies damage.
- At level 1, you may bank +2 per hit.

**Spending from the Critical Damage Bank:**  
After a successful hit (when your damage is applied, surpassing block/parry/counterspell), you may spend crit damage to apply effects from the Critical Effects Table.
- Example: You hit a target and exceed their Absorption and Block. You spend from your CDB to apply a severe injury critical technique that costs 10 banked damage.

**Known Techniques:**  
When spending from your CDB, you may only apply known critical techniques.  

## 3. Defense

**Critical Mitigation:**  
If you block or parry a hit that would apply a critical technique from an opponent, you can spend from your own crit bank to cancel the effect.
- You must fully match the effect’s cost—partial mitigation isn’t allowed.
- You cannot mitigate a natural 20 critical this way.
