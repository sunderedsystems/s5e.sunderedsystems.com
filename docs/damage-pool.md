# Damage Pool

- When you spend SD for a damage action (including spending 2SD in place of a Core Action), SD are added to the damage pool.
- Must declare SD before rolling the d20.
    - If check fails, SD are lost.
    - If successful, roll the pool for total damage.
- SD spent for effect scaling (not damage) are **not** rolled for damage.
