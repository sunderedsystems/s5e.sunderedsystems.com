# Dodge

Dodge is a passive defense based on a character’s Agility.

- A character’s Passive Dodge is equal to their Agility score.
- If the character is proficient in Agility, they add their proficiency bonus to this score.

**Targeting Dodge:**
- Any physical or spell attack that would cause damage and requires line of sight must meet or exceed the target’s Passive Dodge to succeed.
- This is the difficulty of the targeting check.
