# Druid

Classes define your unique strengths.

When multi-classing under level 20, players gain the core feature of a second class at level 10 in that class.

In Ascended play (beyond level 20) a character gains the core feature of any new class they take at level 20 in that class.

## Core Features

### Wildshape
    
- Knows a number of shapes to shift in/out equal to proficiency. Requires a Core Action/equivalent but no DC.
- Wildshape is not totem armor—if the druid dies in Wildshape, they die.
- Cast spells in Wildshape

This is a spell that costs a Core Action or 2SD to activate. The druid rearranges their form, including worn or carried items (and stat block), into a chosen animal form. If it is not one of the druid’s known shapes, they must pass a stressed check to morph into and out of the shape, the difficulty of which is the highest stat of the shape they are shifting into plus 1 for every missing SD. The druid can use wisdom, knowledge, or influence to do so; however, they can only apply proficiency if proficient in the spellcasting ability being utilized.

The druid may cast spells while in wildshape. Spells still require a focus, verbal, or somatic components.

## Class Talents and Fighting Styles

- Start with 2 talents at level 1.
- Gain more talents equal to your proficiency each time proficiency increases.
- May reassign 2 talents each time proficiency increases (or every 5 levels after level 20)

Fighting Styles

Any class may pick a Fighting Style instead of a class talent. You cannot take the same Fighting Style more than once.

**Options:**

- **Ranged:** Increase ranged weapon range by 10ft per proficiency.
- **Defense:** While wearing armor, decrease damage by proficiency an extra time.
- **Dueling:** One-handed weapon + empty offhand—add damage equal to SD spent on attack.
- **Great Weapon Fighting:** When rolling 1 or 2 on a damage die for a two-handed melee weapon, reroll (must use new roll). Weapon must be two-handed or versatile.
- **Protection:** If a creature within 5ft is attacked, you can block for them.
- **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When using two weapons, may use Sleight of Hand vs. Agility for your second attack; on success, disarm or make the target drop an item.

## Talents

---

#### Circle

Choose a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land, Circle of the Moon, Circle of Flame.

#### Nature’s Path

The druid’s attunement with nature slows the effects of time on their body. They age 1 year for every 10 that pass.

---

#### Rejuvenation

The druid recovers extra SD equal to their proficiency on a short rest.

---

#### Nature’s Own

Animals add the druid’s spellcasting modifier to the difficulty of attacks targeting them.

#### Moonwell (requires circle of the moon)

At night, these druids gain an extra SD pool equal to their proficiency. When depleted, it does not replenish until the following night.

---

#### Cinderborn (requires circle of flame)

While Wildshaped, successful attacks deal additional fire damage equal to their proficiency.

---

#### Earthen Shield (requires circle of the land)

These druids take reduced physical damage equal to their proficiency.

#### Nature’s Weave

The Druid learns to weave their spell focus into their Wildshape if it is on their person at the time of change, enabling them to cast spells without verbal or somatic components in Wildshape.
