# Druid

The druid is able to shift into and out of forms at will. They know a number of shapes equal to their proficiency that they can shift into and out of without passing a check.

---

#### Wildshape

This is a concentration spell that costs a Core Action or 2SD to activate. The druid rearranges their form, including worn or carried items (and stat block), into a chosen animal form. If it is not one of the druid’s known shapes, they must pass a stressed check to morph into and out of the shape, the difficulty of which is the highest stat of the shape they are shifting into plus 1 for every missing SD. The druid can use wisdom, knowledge, or influence to do so; however, they can only apply proficiency if proficient in the spellcasting ability being utilized.

The druid may cast spells while in wildshape. Spells still require a focus, verbal, or somatic components.

#### Circle

Choose a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land, Circle of the Moon, Circle of Flame.

---

#### Nature’s Path

The druid’s attunement with nature slows the effects of time on their body. They age 1 year for every 10 that pass.

---

#### Rejuvenation

The druid recovers extra SD equal to their proficiency on a short rest.

---

#### Nature’s Own

Animals add the druid’s spellcasting modifier to the difficulty of attacks targeting them.

---

#### Moonwell (requires circle of the moon)

At night, these druids gain an extra SD pool equal to their proficiency. When depleted, it does not replenish until the following night.

---

#### Cinderborn (requires circle of flame)

While Wildshaped, successful attacks deal additional fire damage equal to their proficiency.

---

#### Earthen Shield (requires circle of the land)

These druids take reduced physical damage equal to their proficiency.

---

#### Nature’s Weave

The Druid learns to weave their spell focus into their Wildshape if it is on their person at the time of change, enabling them to cast spells without verbal or somatic components in Wildshape.
