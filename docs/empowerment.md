# Empowerment

All empowerment spells require concentration and are limited by the caster’s proficiency. They cost a minimum of a Core Action +1 SD (or 10ft of movement) to increase a character's ability score by +1.

## Scaling

- Each +1 increase to an ability score costs 1 SD or 10ft movement.
    - Example: Empowering Strength by +6 costs 6 SD (or 60ft movement) and is considered a 6th-level spell.
- Casting a 6th level empowerment will cost a Core Action (or equivalent) +6 SD.
- You can apply empowerment to multiple tarets by spending 1SD or 10ft of movement for each additional target.

## Proficiency Cap

- The caster must have a proficiency score equal to or greater than the amount the empowerment increases the target’s ability score.
    - Example 1: To grant +6 to Strength, the caster must have Proficiency 6+.

    - Example 2: To grant 3 targets +6 strength, the caster must have a Proficiency of 6+, spend a Core Action +9 SD (or equivalent mix of movemetn and SD)

## Duration

- The empowerment lasts until cancelled.

## Difficulty

- The spell check’s DC is the final total of the ability score being reached. If targeting multiple targets, the highest score achieved among the targets is the DC.
    - Example 1: Increasing a Strength score from 12 to 18 requires a DC 18 check.
