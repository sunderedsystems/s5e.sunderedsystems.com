# Ending Status Effects

To attempt to end an escapable status effect (e.g., Grappled, Restrained, Charmed):

- Spend 2 SD, 20ft movement, or 1 SD + 10ft movement.
- Roll 1d20 + appropriate ability modifier (add proficiency if proficient).
- Succeed vs. the DC or contested roll of the effectâ€™s originator to escape.
