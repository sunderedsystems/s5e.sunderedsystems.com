# Establishing Renown

When entering a community where your deeds matter (heroic, infamous, or disruptive), the GM assigns a Renown pool.

- Renown is used only for social encounters in that region.
- It grants proficiency to social checks (If not proficient, add proficiency. If proficient, add twice)
- Renown is specific to each region and regenerates daily while present.
