# Familiar Range

- If a familiar leaves your plane of existence, it is automatically desummoned.
- To direct a familiarâ€™s actions, you must be within 120ft.
- Beyond 120ft: familiar may follow prior instructions, but not tactical commands.
- If damaged out of range: familiar is desummoned, and you take 1 point of damage.
