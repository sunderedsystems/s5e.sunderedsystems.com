# Familiar Rolls

Familiars make all combat checks using the attuned characterâ€™s spellcasting ability, including:
- The relevant ability modifier
- Proficiency, if the character is proficient in their spellcasting ability

**Example:**  
A familiar directed to melee attack by a Wisdom-based caster would roll a d20 + Wisdom modifier + proficiency (if applicable).
