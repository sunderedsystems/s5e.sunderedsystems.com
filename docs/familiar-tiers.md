# Familiar Tiers

Familiars are tiered like items:  
Common, Uncommon, Rare, Heroic, Legendary, and Mythic.

- Attune familiars using standard item attunement rules.
- Attuning to a familiar replaces the capacity to carry an item of equal Source value.
- You may attune to multiple familiars, but only one Mythic Familiar at a time.
