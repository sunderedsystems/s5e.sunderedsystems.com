# Familiars and Discipline Checks

Familiars may perform checks using any discipline the attuned character is proficient in, treating the familiar as an extension of the attuned’s mind or will.

- These checks use the attuned character’s relevant ability scores, applying modifiers and proficiency if proficient.

**Example:**  
A familiar scouting ahead may make a Stealth or Perception check using the attuned character’s Agility or Knowledge score, respectively.
