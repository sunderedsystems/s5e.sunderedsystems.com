# Gods

Gods are beyond mythic: pure fonts or conduits of cosmic force.

- **Item Attunement:** Typically attuned to a mythic item of their own making (or as a trophy/gift).
- **Echelon:** Occupy the Echelon: Divine — gain 3 echelon categories at once
- **Class:** Occupy the Class: God — may choose abilities from any class.
- **Level Range:** 1–100 (power is not solely from level; scale increases with level).
- **Source Die:** Always a d20, regardless of level.
