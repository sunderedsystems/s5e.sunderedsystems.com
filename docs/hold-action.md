# Hold Action

You may choose to **hold an action** on your turn by specifying a clear trigger (e.g., “If a creature enters my range”).

- No need to pre-commit SD.
- When the trigger occurs, you may take the held action as described.
- If resolving the action would cause you to exceed your proficiency cap in SD spent this round, the check becomes a **stressed task**.
- If the trigger never occurs, no Source is lost.
