# How Learning Works

To learn a spell, the player must:

1. Pass a difficulty check equal to 30 minus the chosen spellcasting ability score, plus the level of the spell.
2. Expend a Core Action and SD equal to the spell’s level.

Example: A character with 17 Wisdom attempting to learn a 2nd-level spell would face a DC 15 check (30 − 17 + 2 = 15), and must spend 1 Core Action and 2 SD or the equivalent.
