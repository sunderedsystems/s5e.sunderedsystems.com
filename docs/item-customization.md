# Item Customization

- Item attributes (damage type, effect, enhancement, conduit type, etc.) must be chosen at the time of crafting.
- Maximum number of attributes: 9.
- Attributes can affect type, function, trigger condition, energy type, and special interactions.

> For example:  
> A wizard could craft a wand that generates a mana shield (1st attribute) that activates when damage would be applied to the attuned (2nd attribute). Alternatively, the mana shield could be activated on command, leaving the 2nd attribute slot open (commands are not attributes).
