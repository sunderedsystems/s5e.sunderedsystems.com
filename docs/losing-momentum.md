# Losing Momentum

A party loses a momentum token when:
- A player rolls a critical failure (natural 1), or
- Fails a stressed or strained check.

If the party has at least one momentum token, one is returned to the neutral pool.  
If the party has no tokens, nothing happens (tokens remain in the neutral pool).  
Momentum is never given directly to the other side through these failures.
