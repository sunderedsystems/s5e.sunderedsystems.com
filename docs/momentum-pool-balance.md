# Momentum Pool Balance

The GM can gain momentum tokens like players. If one side controls more than half of the tokens:
- That side ignores stress penalties on stressed checks (no +1 to DC but the checks are still “stressed/strained”).
- If the opposing side rolls a critical success or succeeds on a stressed/strained check when there are no tokens in the neutral pool, one token is removed from the dominant side and returned to neutral.
- Momentum can be won again from neutral by further critical successes, allowing momentum to swing back and forth.
