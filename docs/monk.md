# Monk

Classes define your unique strengths.

When multi-classing under level 20, players gain the core feature of a second class at level 10 in that class.

In Ascended play (beyond level 20) a character gains the core feature of any new class they take at level 20 in that class.

## Core Features

### Ki

- Gain 1 Ki for every even monk level (max 10).
- Spend Ki instead of SD on abilities (total spent per turn cannot exceed proficiency). Ki replenishes simultaneously with SD.

### Natural Born Fighter

- You gain an extra fighting style. It does not count against your talents.

## Class Talents and Fighting Styles

- Start with 2 talents at level 1.
- Gain more talents equal to your proficiency each time proficiency increases.
- May reassign 2 talents each time proficiency increases (or every 5 levels after level 20)

## Fighting Styles

Any class may pick a Fighting Style instead of a class talent. You cannot take the same Fighting Style more than once.

**Options:**

- **Ranged:** Increase ranged weapon range by 10ft per proficiency.
- **Defense:** While wearing armor, decrease damage by proficiency an extra time.
- **Dueling:** One-handed weapon + empty offhand—add damage equal to SD spent on attack.
- **Great Weapon Fighting:** When rolling 1 or 2 on a damage die for a two-handed melee weapon, reroll (must use new roll). Weapon must be two-handed or versatile.
- **Protection:** If a creature within 5ft is attacked, you can block for them.
- **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When using two weapons, may use Sleight of Hand vs. Agility for your second attack; on success, disarm or make the target drop an item.

## Talents

#### Grace

While wearing no armor, the monk may block using their spellcasting modifier instead of their strength modifier.

---

#### Swift Blows

When making a melee attack, the monk may spend one ki to make two additional strikes. They may only increase the damage pool of these strikes by spending from their ki SD. The proficiency cap may not be exceeded when increasing the damage pool.

---

#### Subtle Shift

The monk may spend one ki to disengage and gain 10ft of movement speed this round.

---

#### Windstep

While not wearing armor, the monk is able to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids without falling as long as they are in motion.

---

#### Seikuken

The monk may spend ki to reduce the damage of incoming non-magical missiles. If they reduce the damage of an incoming missile to zero, they may make a proficient ranged attack using the missile against an enemy target within 20ft.

---

#### Art of Lightness

The monk takes less fall damage equal to their proficiency plus dexterity. Additionally, they may spend ki to reduce fall damage.

---

#### Stunning Strike

If the monk spends ki to make a successful melee attack, they may attempt to stun the target. Make an additional check against the target’s Constitution. On a success, the target is stunned and loses their next turn. If the target successfully counters the original strike, they are not stunned.

---

#### Stillness

The monk can use their Core Action to end one effect on themself that is causing them to be charmed or frightened.

---

#### Purity

The monk’s mastery of the ki flowing through them makes them immune to disease and poison.

---

#### Diamond Soul

The monk may spend 1 ki to reroll a failed counter.

---

#### Timeless Body

The monk’s ki sustains them so that they suffer none of the frailty of old age, and they can’t be aged magically. The monk can still die of old age, however. In addition, they no longer need food or water.

---

#### Empty Body

The monk can spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. They may increase the duration 1 minute per 4 ki spent. During that time, they also have resistance to all damage.

Additionally, the monk can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, however they cannot take anyone with them when using this method. The spell lasts until they make a wisdom check to re-enter their body. This is a stressed task.

---

#### Perfect Self

When the monk rolls for initiative and has no ki remaining, they regain ki equal to their proficiency.
