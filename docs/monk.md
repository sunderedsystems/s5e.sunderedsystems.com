#### Windstep

While not wearing armor, the monk is able to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids without falling as long as they are in motion.

#### Seikuken

The monk may spend ki to reduce the damage of incoming non-magical missiles. If they reduce the damage of an incoming missile to zero, they may make a proficient ranged attack using the missile against an enemy target within 20ft.

---

#### Art of Lightness

The monk takes less fall damage equal to their proficiency plus dexterity. Additionally, they may spend ki to reduce fall damage.

---

#### Stunning Strike

If the monk spends ki to make a successful melee attack, they may attempt to stun the target. Make an additional check against the target’s Constitution. On a success, the target is stunned and loses their next turn. If the target successfully counters the original strike, they are not stunned.

#### Stillness

The monk can use their Core Action to end one effect on themself that is causing them to be charmed or frightened.

#### Purity

The monk’s mastery of the ki flowing through them makes them immune to disease and poison.

#### Diamond Soul

The monk may spend 1 ki to reroll a failed counter.

#### Timeless Body

The monk’s ki sustains them so that they suffer none of the frailty of old age, and they can’t be aged magically. The monk can still die of old age, however. In addition, they no longer need food or water.

---

#### Empty Body

The monk can spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. They may increase the duration 1 minute per 4 ki spent. During that time, they also have resistance to all damage.

Additionally, the monk can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell, however they cannot take anyone with them when using this method. The spell lasts until they make a wisdom check to re-enter their body. This is a stressed task.

#### Perfect Self

When the monk rolls for initiative and has no ki remaining, they regain 4 ki.
