# Multiple Concentration Spells

A player may concentrate on multiple spells simultaneously, but doing so comes at a cost:

- For each additional concentration spell beyond the first, the player suffers a –3 penalty to all ability scores, excluding the spellcasting ability used to maintain concentration.
- While maintaining more than one concentration spell, the player’s movement is reduced by 20 ft per additional concentration spell.
- Movement speed can be reduced to 0ft or negative movement by this penalty.
- These penalties persist for the full duration of the additional concentration spells.
- A concentration spell can be freely ended by the caster at any time.
- Ability scores cannot be reduced below 1 by these penalties. If an additional concentration spell would reduce an ability score below 1, that spell automatically fails.

When the number of concentration spells returns to one or zero, ability scores are restored immediately and movement speed replenishes at the start of the player’s next turn.
