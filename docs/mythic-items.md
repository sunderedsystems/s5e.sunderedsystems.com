# Mythic Items

Mythic items are divine constructs, infused with overwhelming power.

- **SD Pool:** 20d20 or more committed during crafting.
- **Effect:** Increases the creature's base SD by their level.
- **Grant the wielder access to more power, enabling them to expend source up to their character level on their turn** (instead of up to their proficiency). However, exceeding their proficiency cap within a round still incurs strain on an action.
- **Limit:** One mythic item attunement per creature.
- **Attunement Requirement:** Must have 10+ in Wisdom, Knowledge, or Influence.
