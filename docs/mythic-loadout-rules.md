# Mythic Loadout Rules

- Your magic item SD total must not exceed your base SD, including your mythic expansion.

**Example:**

- Level 17 character with a Mythic Item (adds +17 to base SD).
- Base SD = 20 â†’ becomes 37.
- The player may carry up to 37 item SD total (e.g., three Legendary items totaling 36 SD is legal).
- Total usable SD = Character SD + Item SD = 37 + 36 = 73.
