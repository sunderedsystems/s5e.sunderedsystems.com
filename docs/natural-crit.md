# Natural Crit

A Natural Crit occurs when a player rolls a natural 20 on a d20.

- Deal the maximum possible damage from your damage pool (no roll).
- Apply any critical effect from the Critical Table at or below your total damage tier.
- Status effects from a Natural Crit cannot be prevented except by a critical counterspell.
