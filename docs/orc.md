# Open RPG Creative License (ORC)

This document contains the text and essential information for the **Open RPG Creative (ORC) License**, developed by Paizo Publishing and Azora Law. This license governs certain game mechanics and rules content used in the *Sundered 5e* ruleset via the Pathfinder system.

This is the authoritative, legally registered version (Library of Congress TX 9‚Äë307‚Äë067).

## üß© How It Works

- Mechanics (game rules, actions, statblocks, etc.) are automatically considered **Licensed Material**.
- Non-mechanical elements (such as setting, lore, trademarks) are treated as **Reserved Material** unless expressly released as Licensed Material.
- When you use, adapt, or publish *Licensed Material*, your own mechanics become Licensed Material under the **same ORC terms**.
