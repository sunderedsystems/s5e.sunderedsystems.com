# Paladin

#### Paladins are driven by unwavering ideals. Some go so far as to swear sacred oaths, devoting themselves to a god, a principle, or a cosmic (dis)order that mirrors their understanding of existence.

Classes define your unique strengths.

When multi-classing under level 20, players gain the core feature of a second class at level 10 in that class.

In Ascended play (beyond level 20) a character gains the core feature of any new class they take at level 20 in that class.

## Core Features

### Aura

- Emit an aura with a radius of 5ft per point of proficiency.

Allies within the aura:

- Are immune to fear

- Add paladin proficiency to Block and Parry absorption (in addition to their own)

- Deal additional damage as smite (Paladin Proficiency) on melee, ranged, or spell attacks originating within the aura

- All bonuses are in addition to base proficiencies.

### Natural Born Fighter

- You gain an extra fighting style. It does not count against your talents.

## Class Talents and Fighting Styles

- Start with 2 talents at level 1.
- Gain more talents equal to your proficiency each time proficiency increases.
- May reassign 2 talents each time proficiency increases (or every 5 levels after level 20)

## Fighting Styles

Any class may pick a Fighting Style instead of a class talent. You cannot take the same Fighting Style more than once.

**Options:**

- **Ranged:** Increase ranged weapon range by 10ft per proficiency.
- **Defense:** While wearing armor, decrease damage by proficiency an extra time.
- **Dueling:** One-handed weapon + empty offhand—add damage equal to SD spent on attack.
- **Great Weapon Fighting:** When rolling 1 or 2 on a damage die for a two-handed melee weapon, reroll (must use new roll). Weapon must be two-handed or versatile.
- **Protection:** If a creature within 5ft is attacked, you can block for them.
- **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When using two weapons, may use Sleight of Hand vs. Agility for your second attack; on success, disarm or make the target drop an item.

#### Divine sense (1SRA or 2SD)
The paladin is able to sense the creature type of beings near them by making an insight check against the highest influence of all creatures within range of the paladin aura. On a success, this sense pierces illusions, shapechanging, and concealment, but does not reveal specific identities: only the true nature of what lies near the paladin (Aberrations, Beasts, Celestials, Constructs, Dragons, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, Giants, Humanoids, Monstrosities, Oozes, Plants, and Undead).

---

#### Lay on Hands
The paladin can restore hit points to a target by sacrificing their own. As a Core Action, the paladin may transfer any number of their hit points to a creature they can touch, up to the paladin’s current hit point total. They may do this a number of times equal to their constitution modifier until their Source fully replenishes, by conversion or a long rest.

---

#### Cleanse
The paladin may spend 1 SD to attempt to remove one spell or status effect (such as poisoned or stunned) from a creature within range of the Paladin aura. Make a Stressed Influence check against a DC equal to 30 minus the target creature’s Constitution score.

---

#### Divine Health
The paladin is immune to disease.

---

#### Devotion
Creatures within the paladin aura cannot be charmed.

---

#### Holy Nimbus
Targets that begin their turn within the paladin aura take radiant damage equal to the paladin’s proficiency.

---

#### Piety
The paladin is always under the effect of “protection from evil and good”.

---

#### Channel divinity
The paladin can use one Divine Sense or Turn the Unbeliever without Source cost once per full replenishment.

---

#### Turn the unbeliever (1SRA + 2SD)
As an action, the paladin makes a Stressed Influence check against the highest influence score among all target creatures within the paladin aura. On a success, the affected targets are feared for a number of rounds equal to the paladin’s proficiency. While feared, they must use all available movement and SD to flee from the paladin. If an affected creature cannot flee, it takes damage equal to the paladin’s proficiency at the start of its turn for every round it remains within the aura.
