# Paladin

Paladins are driven by unwavering ideals. Some go so far as to swear sacred oaths, devoting themselves to a god, a principle, or a cosmic (dis)order that mirrors their understanding of existence.

#### Fighting Style

Paladins gain access to a Fighting Style at level one.

---

#### Divine sense (1SRA or 2SD)
The paladin is able to sense the creature type of beings near them by making an insight check against the highest influence of all creatures within range of the paladin aura. On a success, this sense pierces illusions, shapechanging, and concealment, but does not reveal specific identities: only the true nature of what lies near the paladin (Aberrations, Beasts, Celestials, Constructs, Dragons, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, Giants, Humanoids, Monstrosities, Oozes, Plants, and Undead).

---

#### Lay on Hands
The paladin can restore hit points to a target by sacrificing their own. As a Core Action, the paladin may transfer any number of their hit points to a creature they can touch, up to the paladin’s current hit point total. They may do this a number of times equal to their constitution modifier until their Source fully replenishes, by conversion or a long rest.

---

#### Cleanse
The paladin may spend 1 SD to attempt to remove one spell or status effect (such as poisoned or stunned) from a creature within range of the Paladin aura. Make a Stressed Influence check against a DC equal to 30 minus the target creature’s Constitution score.

---

#### Divine Health
The paladin is immune to disease.

---

#### Devotion
Creatures within the paladin aura cannot be charmed.

---

#### Holy Nimbus
Targets that begin their turn within the paladin aura take radiant damage equal to the paladin’s proficiency.

---

#### Piety
The paladin is always under the effect of “protection from evil and good”.

---

#### Channel divinity
The paladin can use one Divine Sense or Turn the Unbeliever without Source cost once per full replenishment.

---

#### Turn the unbeliever (1SRA + 2SD)
As an action, the paladin makes a Stressed Influence check against the highest influence score among all target creatures within the paladin aura. On a success, the affected targets are feared for a number of rounds equal to the paladin’s proficiency. While feared, they must use all available movement and SD to flee from the paladin. If an affected creature cannot flee, it takes damage equal to the paladin’s proficiency at the start of its turn for every round it remains within the aura.
