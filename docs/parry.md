# Parry

If you are wielding a melee weapon, you may Parry an incoming melee attack by committing Source Dice (SD) up to your proficiency, (minimum 1SD), or by spending unspent movement (increments of 10ft).

- Roll the committed SD (and/or apply movement spent).
- Reduce incoming damage by your:
    - Agility modifier
    - Proficiency (if proficient in Agility)
    - SD roll
- **Dig In:** Spend unspent movement to reduce damage by –1 per 10ft spent.

**Example:**  
You’re being hit for 17 damage. You commit 3SD (roll: 10), your Agility mod is +3, you are not proficient, and you Dig In with 20ft movement (–2).  
Total absorbed: 10 (SD) + 3 (Agi) + 0 (Prof) + 2 (Dig In) = 15.  
The attack deals 2 damage.

- You must have a melee weapon in hand to Parry.
- You cannot Parry magical or ranged attacks.
