# Proficiency Cap

- The Proficiency Cap (PC) is the **maximum number of Source Dice (SD) you can spend on a single action** (attack, counter, spell, etc.).
    - This cap does not apply to crafting.

- Exceeding the cap in a round makes the action a **Strained Action or Stressed Task** (see: Stress and Strain).
