# Ranger

Classes define your unique strengths.

When multi-classing under level 20, players gain the core feature of a second class at level 10 in that class.

In Ascended play (beyond level 20) a character gains the core feature of any new class they take at level 20 in that class.

## Core Features

### Swift

- Base movement speed increased by 20ft

### Natural Born Fighter

- You gain an extra fighting style. It does not count against your talents.

## Class Talents and Fighting Styles

- Start with 2 talents at level 1.
- Gain more talents equal to your proficiency each time proficiency increases.
- May reassign 2 talents each time proficiency increases (or every 5 levels after level 20)

## Fighting Styles

Any class may pick a Fighting Style instead of a class talent. You cannot take the same Fighting Style more than once.

**Options:**

- **Ranged:** Increase ranged weapon range by 10ft per proficiency.
- **Defense:** While wearing armor, decrease damage by proficiency an extra time.
- **Dueling:** One-handed weapon + empty offhand—add damage equal to SD spent on attack.
- **Great Weapon Fighting:** When rolling 1 or 2 on a damage die for a two-handed melee weapon, reroll (must use new roll). Weapon must be two-handed or versatile.
- **Protection:** If a creature within 5ft is attacked, you can block for them.
- **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When using two weapons, may use Sleight of Hand vs. Agility for your second attack; on success, disarm or make the target drop an item.

### Favored enemy
The ranger has significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain enemy type.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, they can select four races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.

The ranger has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track their favored enemies, as well as on Knowledge checks to recall information about them.

The ranger also learns one language of choice that is spoken by their favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

### Favored terrain
The ranger is particularly familiar with certain types of natural environment and is adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose 3 types of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. While traveling in their favored terrain, the ranger gains the following benefits:
- Difficult terrain doesn't slow their group's travel.
- The ranger’s group can't become lost except by magical means.
- Even when the ranger is engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), they remain alert to danger.
- If the ranger is traveling alone, they can move stealthily at a normal pace.
- When the ranger forages, they find twice as much food as others normally would.
- While tracking other creatures, the ranger also learns their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

### Primeval Awareness
The ranger can spend SD up to their proficiency to gain an awareness within (xSD)miles of what creature types are in range. They know their direction but not distance or location.

---

### Landstrider
Moving through non-magical difficult terrain costs them no extra movement. The ranger can also pass through non-magical plants without being slowed and without taking damage if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. Additionally, the ranger has advantage when countering the effects of magical plants, such as those conjured from entangle.

---

### Camouflage
The ranger can spend 1SD creating camouflage for themself. They must have access to naturally occurring materials with which to create the camouflage.

Once the ranger is camouflaged in this way, they can hide by pressing up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as they are. The ranger is hidden against passive perception checks for the duration. Once they move or take an action or counteraction, they must camouflage again to gain this benefit.

---

### Hide
Hide is a stressed task in combat. One may either use the Hide Core Action normally, or spend 1 SD and 10ft of movement to attempt to hide against the highest Perception among creatures who can see the ranger within 60ft. Also, the ranger can't be tracked by non-magical means unless they choose to leave a trail.

---

### Shadowmeld
While motionless and in darkness, the ranger cannot be seen except by magical means. They may spend 1 SD to move up to 10ft while maintaining this effect, and this movement does not provoke counterattack effects. The effect ends if the ranger takes any action other than movement. The ranger may react while melded, but doing so reveals their location.

---

### Feral senses
When the ranger attacks a creature they can't see, the inability to see doesn't impose disadvantage on their attack rolls against it. The ranger is also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet, provided that the creature isn't hidden and the ranger isn’t blinded or deafened.

---

### Foe slayer
The ranger is an unparalleled hunter of their enemies. They can add their Wisdom modifier to an attack roll or the damage roll of an attack made against favored enemies. If wisdom is their targeting ability and the ranger is proficient in wisdom, they may add their wisdom modifier a second time.

---

### Giant killer
The ranger can make a melee counterattack against a creature larger than them that hits or misses the ranger with a melee attack.

---

### Feral Stalker
When the ranger deals damage to a creature they have tracked for at least one hour, it must make a stressed Fear check (using its Influence vs the ranger’s spellcasting ability of choice plus relevant proficiency). On a failure, the creature is Frightened of the ranger for 1 round per point of the ranger’s proficiency. A creature that succeeds this check becomes immune to this effect from the ranger for the next 24 hours.

---

### Feral Edge
Counterattacks against the ranger from creatures they have damaged are made with disadvantage.

---

### Agile Defender
When a creature successfully deals damage to the ranger, all subsequent attacks made by that creature against them are treated as Stressed Tasks until the start of the creature’s next turn.

---

### Volley
The ranger can use a Core Action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures (up to their proficiency) within 10 feet of a point they can see within weapon’s range, targeting the highest agility of creatures within that point. One may increase the area of effect or damage of this action by spending SD.

---

### Whirlwind Attack
The ranger can use a Core Action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of them up to their proficiency, targeting the highest agility of creatures within range. One may increase the area of effect or damage of this action by spending SD.
