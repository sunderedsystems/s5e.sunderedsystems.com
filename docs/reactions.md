## Counteraction

A Counteraction is a reaction to sudden, untargeted threatsâ€”such as traps, falling objects, or magical surges.

To perform a Counteraction, the player must immediately spend one of the following:
- 20ft of movement
- 10ft of movement + 1 SD

Make the appropriate d20 check (as determined by GM) to avoid or negate the threat. This is always a stressed check (increase the difficulty by +1 for every missing SD).
