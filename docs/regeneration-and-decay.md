# Regeneration and Decay

- **Regeneration:** The pool refreshes each dawn while the party remains in the region.
- **Decay:** If the party leaves, Renown fades at a pace set by the GM (–1 token per week/month/year).
- Deeds may become exaggerated, forgotten, or even challenged.

To maintain or grow Renown, players must return and continue engaging with the community—helping, disrupting, or otherwise making themselves known.
