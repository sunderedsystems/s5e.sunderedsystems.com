# Rogue

---

### Expertise
The rogue gains 2 extra disciplines with which they are proficient.

---

### Sneak Attack
When the rogue makes a successful attack against a creature that is either unaware of them or engaged by one of their allies, they deal additional damage equal to their proficiency plus the number of SD committed to the attack.

---

### Thieves Cant
During the rogueâ€™s training they learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows the rogue to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understand such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, the rogue understands a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

---

### Like Shadow
Once per round, the rogue is able to disengage, even if they are out of movement.

---

### Uncanny Dodge
On their turn, the rogue may spend a Core Action or 2 SD to cause attackers targeting their agility to treat the attack as a stressed task. The effect lasts until a successful attack is made against the rogue.

---

### Home in the Dark
If the rogue is able to hear, they are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet.

---

### Reliability
If the rogue expends 1 or more SD and rolls a 9 or lower on a non combat ability or discipline they are proficient in, they may treat the roll as a 10.

---

### Like Mist
Attack rolls against the rogue cannot be made with advantage until they have been hit within a round.

---

### Weighted Dice
When making a d20 check, the rogue may roll a d4 and add it to the check before the result is known. If they fail the check, they may not use this talent again until their Source is fully replenished.

---

### Fast Hands
It does not cost the rogue a Core Action or SD for their first attempt at using thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or interact/use an item.

---

### Acrophilia
Climbing does not cost the rogue extra movement speed.

---

### Underestimated Sneakiness
The rogue has advantage on stealth checks.

---

### Magic hands
The rogue ignores all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.

---

### Always on the Lookout
The rogue can take two turns during the first round of any combat. They take the first turn at normal initiative and the second turn at the end of the round.
