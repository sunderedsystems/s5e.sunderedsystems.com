# Rogue

Classes define your unique strengths.

When multi-classing under level 20, players gain the core feature of a second class at level 10 in that class.

In Ascended play (beyond level 20) a character gains the core feature of any new class they take at level 20 in that class.

## Core Features

### Surprise Attack

- Stealthed attacks or attacks on targets engaged with an ally lower DC by proficiency.

### Like Shadow
- Rogues have no movement penalty in stealth.

### Natural Born Fighter

- You gain an extra fighting style. It does not count against your talents.

## Class Talents and Fighting Styles

- Start with 2 talents at level 1.
- Gain more talents equal to your proficiency each time proficiency increases.
- May reassign 2 talents each time proficiency increases (or every 5 levels after level 20)

## Fighting Styles

Any class may pick a Fighting Style instead of a class talent. You cannot take the same Fighting Style more than once.

**Options:**

- **Ranged:** Increase ranged weapon range by 10ft per proficiency.
- **Defense:** While wearing armor, decrease damage by proficiency an extra time.
- **Dueling:** One-handed weapon + empty offhand—add damage equal to SD spent on attack.
- **Great Weapon Fighting:** When rolling 1 or 2 on a damage die for a two-handed melee weapon, reroll (must use new roll). Weapon must be two-handed or versatile.
- **Protection:** If a creature within 5ft is attacked, you can block for them.
- **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When using two weapons, may use Sleight of Hand vs. Agility for your second attack; on success, disarm or make the target drop an item.

### Expertise
The rogue gains 2 extra disciplines with which they are proficient.

---

### Opportunist
When the rogue makes a successful attack against a creature that is either unaware of them or engaged by one of their allies, they deal additional damage equal to their proficiency plus the number of SD committed to the attack.

---

### Thieves Cant
During the rogue’s training they learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows the rogue to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understand such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, the rogue understands a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

---

### Like Mist
The rogue is able to disengage, even if they are out of movement.

---

### Uncanny Dodge
On their turn, the rogue may spend a Core Action or 2 SD to cause attackers targeting their agility to treat the attack as a stressed task. The effect lasts until a successful attack is made against the rogue.

---

### Home in the Dark
If the rogue is able to hear, they are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet.

---

### Reliability
If the rogue expends 1 or more SD and rolls a 9 or lower on a non combat ability or discipline they are proficient in, they may treat the roll as a 10.

---

### Now You See Me
Attack rolls against the rogue cannot be made with advantage until they have been hit within a round.

---

### Weighted Dice
When making a d20 check, the rogue may spend 2SD to add their spellcasting modifier to the check before the roll resolves.

---

### Fast Hands
It does not cost the rogue a Core Action or SD for their first attempt at using thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or interact/use an item.

---

### Acrophilia
Climbing does not cost the rogue extra movement speed.

---

### Underestimated Sneakiness
The rogue has advantage on stealth checks.

---

### Magic hands
The rogue ignores all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.

---

### Always on the Lookout
The rogue can take two turns during the first round of any combat. They take the first turn at normal initiative and the second turn at the end of the round.
