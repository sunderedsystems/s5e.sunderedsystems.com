# Scaling Spells

## Source Scaling

When casting a spell that deals damage or applies a status effect, the caster may spend additional SD to:

- Increase damage (adds to damage pool)
- Increase area of effect
- Increase duration (1 round per SD spent)
- Increase range
- Increase number of targets (one additional target per SD)

Only SD committed to the damage pool may be rolled for damage.

- Increasing the SD spent on a spell also increases the SD cost for an opponent to counter that spell.
- Committing SD beyond your proficiency cap causes the spell to be a strained action.
- All spells, including cantrips, may be scaled by increasing the SD spent.
