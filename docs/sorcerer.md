# Sorcerer

Classes define your unique strengths.

When multi-classing under level 20, players gain the core feature of a second class at level 10 in that class.

In Ascended play (beyond level 20) a character gains the core feature of any new class they take at level 20 in that class.

## Core Features

### Metamagic

- Gains one Metamagic talent that does not count against their total talents. 

## Class Talents and Fighting Styles

- Start with 2 talents at level 1.
- Gain more talents equal to your proficiency each time proficiency increases.
- May reassign 2 talents each time proficiency increases (or every 5 levels after level 20)

## Fighting Styles

Any class may pick a Fighting Style instead of a class talent. You cannot take the same Fighting Style more than once.

**Options:**

- **Ranged:** Increase ranged weapon range by 10ft per proficiency.
- **Defense:** While wearing armor, decrease damage by proficiency an extra time.
- **Dueling:** One-handed weapon + empty offhand—add damage equal to SD spent on attack.
- **Great Weapon Fighting:** When rolling 1 or 2 on a damage die for a two-handed melee weapon, reroll (must use new roll). Weapon must be two-handed or versatile.
- **Protection:** If a creature within 5ft is attacked, you can block for them.
- **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When using two weapons, may use Sleight of Hand vs. Agility for your second attack; on success, disarm or make the target drop an item.

### Metamagic

**Careful spell**  
When the sorcerer casts an untargeted area of effect spell, they can choose a number of targets equal to the SD spent on the spell to shield from the spells effects.

**Distant spell**  
When spending SD to upgrade the distance of a spell, the sorcerer doubles the added distance per SD spent.

**Empowered spell**  
When spending SD to increase the damage of a spell, the sorcerer may reroll any number of the damage pool one time. They must use the new rolls.

**Extended spell**  
When spending SD to increase the duration of a spell, the sorcerer doubles the added duration per SD spent.

**Heightened spell**  
If the sorcerer spends Source on a spell that targets an ability score, they may spend 1SD to lower the difficulty of the check by -1 per SD spent.

**Quickened spell**  
If the sorcerer spends SD to cast a spell or ritual that typically takes more than a Core Action to resolve, they can cut that spell’s time in half.

**Subtle spell**  
The sorcerer can cast spells without a focus, verbal, or somatic components. However, some part of their body (their hands, eyes, a birthmark) will glow brightly in all spectrums of light, affecting their ability to be unseen.

**Twinned spell**  
When the sorcerer spends 1 or more SD to cast a spell that targets only one creature, (even if that creature is themself), they may duplicate the spell once without expending SD to do so.

### Sorcerous origin: Draconic Bloodline

**Draconic Resilience**  
The sorcerer’s skin has taken on aspects of their draconic ancestry. It might shimmer with a subtle chatoyance, develop textured patches, or manifest hardened scales. This natural magic-infused armor grants the sorcerer enhanced resilience. When blocking or countering a spell, they decrease damage taken by an additional amount equal to the number of SD spent on the counter.

**Elemental affinity**  
When the sorcerer casts a spell that deals damage of the type associated with their draconic ancestry, they gain resistance to damage of that type until they cast a spell of a different damage type.

**Dragon Wings**  
The sorcerer has the ability to manifest dragon wings that remain until dismissed. Manifesting or dismissing the wings requires a constitution check equal to 30 minus their constitution score. In combat this is a stressed check. If the sorcerer is wearing armor, it must be able to accommodate these wings. The draconic sorcerer has a flying speed equal to their movement speed while they have these wings.

**Draconic presence**  
The sorcerer’s presence inspires awe or fear. They can spend SD to target creatures within 30ft at 1 SD per creature and make an Influence check against the highest Influence score among those creatures. On a success, each targeted creature rolls with disadvantage on their first check targeting the sorcerer (combat or social).
