# Sorcerer

---

### Metamagic

**Careful spell**  
When the sorcerer casts an area of effect spell, they can choose a number of targets equal to the SD spent on the spell to shield from the spells effects.

**Distant spell**  
When spending SD to upgrade the distance of a spell, the sorcerer doubles the added distance per SD spent.

**Empowered spell**  
When spending SD to increase the damage of a spell, the sorcerer may reroll any number of the damage pool one time. They must use the new rolls.

**Extended spell**  
When spending SD to increase the duration of a spell, the sorcerer doubles the added duration per SD spent.

**Heightened spell**  
If the sorcerer spends 2 or more SD on a spell that targets an ability score, they may roll with advantage. The sorcerer can do this once per round in combat. If used outside of combat, each additional use before a rest becomes a stressed task.

**Quickened spell**  
If the sorcerer spends SD to cast a spell or ritual that typically takes more than a Core Action to resolve, they can cut that spell’s time in half.

**Subtle spell**  
The sorcerer can cast spells without a focus, verbal, or somatic components. However, some part of their body (their hands, eyes, a birthmark) will glow brightly in all spectrums of light, affecting their ability to be unseen.

**Twinned spell**  
When the sorcerer spends 1 or more SD to cast a spell that targets only one creature, (even if that creature is themself), they may duplicate the spell once without expending SD to do so.

### Sorcerous origin: Draconic Bloodline

**Draconic Resilience**  
The sorcerer’s skin has taken on aspects of their draconic ancestry. It might shimmer with a subtle chatoyance, develop textured patches, or manifest hardened scales. This natural magic-infused armor grants the sorcerer enhanced resilience. When blocking or countering a spell, they decrease damage taken by an additional amount equal to the number of SD spent on the counter.

**Elemental affinity**  
When the sorcerer casts a spell that deals damage of the type associated with their draconic ancestry, they gain resistance to damage of that type until they cast a spell of a different damage type.

**Dragon Wings**  
The sorcerer has the ability to manifest dragon wings that remain until dismissed. Manifesting or dismissing the wings requires a constitution check equal to 30 minus their constitution score. In combat this is a stressed check. If the sorcerer is wearing armor, it must be able to accommodate these wings. The draconic sorcerer has a flying speed equal to their movement speed while they have these wings.

**Draconic presence**  
The sorcerer’s presence inspires awe or fear. They can spend SD to target creatures within 30ft at 1 SD per creature and make an Influence check against the highest Influence score among those creatures. On a success, each targeted creature rolls with disadvantage on their first check targeting the sorcerer (combat or social).
