# Source Dice

All characters begin with a **Source Pool** of dice, used to fuel special abilities, extra attacks, and more.

### Source Pool Progression

| Level | Source Pool |
|-------|-------------|
| 1     | 6d6         |
| 5     | 8d8         |
| 9     | 10d10       |
| 13    | 12d12       |
| 17    | 20d20       |

### Hit Points

- Before level 17:  
  **HP = Source Dice size × Source Pool**  
  (Example: At level 5, with 8d8 SD, HP = 8 × 8 = 64)
- Level 17+:  
  **HP = 20 × your Constitution score** (not modifier)
