# Source Regeneration

Magical items restore their Source when not actively used:

- Begins regenerating 1 SD at 1 hour of non-use.
- Each hour of non-use doubles the amount restored:
    - 1 hour: +1 SD
    - 2 hours: +2 SD
    - 3 hours: +4 SD
    - Etc., until full.
- Using the item for any action resets this timer.
