# Spell Casting

Anyone can learn and cast a spell using one of the spellcasting abilities: Influence, Knowledge, or Wisdom.

- Add proficiency bonus to spellcasting checks only if you are proficient in that spellcasting ability.

## Casting Requirements

- Casting a spell requires either verbal or somatic components unless you have a spell focus or feature that removes this requirement. (Spell focuses remove the need for verbal or somatic components)
- Casting a spell costs a Core Action and an amount of SD equal to the spell’s level, or a combination of converted costs like 3SD for a level one spell, or 30ft of movement speed.
- Casting a spell that exceeds your proficiency in level is a strained action. This means you may spend 50ft of movement to cast a 3rd level spell at level one when your proficiency is +2. However, it increases the DC by +1 for each missing Source Dice in your total pool.
- Only spells with a designated level (like Misty Step, 3rd level) count toward the proficiency cap.
- Spells do not gain levels by scaling.

## Base Spell Damage

When you cast a spell that deals damage, the Source Dice (SD) spent to cast the base spell are included in the damage pool.

- The base spell refers to the spell as written — without any additional SD spent to enhance it.
- Base damage for a damaging spell is:  
  Spellcasting Modifier + Proficiency (if proficient) + SD spent to cast (equal to spell’s level).

Example: Fireball (level 3), Knowledge 18 (+4), Proficiency +2 = 4 + 2 + 3SD rolled for damage.
