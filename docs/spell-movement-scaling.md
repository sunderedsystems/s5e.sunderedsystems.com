# Spell Movement Scaling

## Arcane Advantage

You may spend 10ft of movement speed to scale or enhance a spell during casting. Each 10ft sacrificed grants one of the following:

- +1 damage
- +1 target
- +1 round of duration
- +10ft to range or area of effect

Movement must be committed before casting, like Source Dice (SD), and is lost whether or not the spell succeeds.

Arcane Advantage increases the SD/movement cost of countering the spell by an equal amount (1SD per 10ft.)
