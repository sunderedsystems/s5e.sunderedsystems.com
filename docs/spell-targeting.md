# Spell Targeting

Spell targeting follows the Stressed/Strained, Contested/Uncontested, and Targeted/Untargeted rules.

- Spells targeting creatures must pass a check against the creature’s targeted ability score (see spell’s description).
- If the spell targets multiple creatures, the caster rolls against the highest relevant ability score among the targets.
- If the spell does not target a creature (e.g., affecting objects or the environment), the base DC is 30 minus the caster’s spellcasting ability score, unless otherwise contested.
