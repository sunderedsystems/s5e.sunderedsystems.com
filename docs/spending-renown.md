# Spending Renown

Players can spend Renown tokens on social checks, but only when interacting with individuals or systems influenced by their reputation in that area. This includes:
- Social leverage (advantage on social checks)
- Favors or exemptions (free lodging, waiving fees, permission to bear arms, reduced spell or item costs)
- Commanding attention (gain an audience, inspire a crowd, sway a mob)
- Access to restricted services (private guild contracts, closed-door auctions, military aid)

Renown cannot be spent in combatâ€”its power lies in narrative, social, and political leverage.
