# Strain

- If you exceed your proficiency cap for SD spent in a round, the check becomes a **strained check**.
- Strained DC: +1 for each SD already missing from your pool when you make the check.

**Example:**  
If you have 4 of 6 SD left, proficiency +3, already spent 2 SD this round. Commit 3 more SD to counter a spell (over cap): Since 2 SD are missing, DC is increased by +2.
