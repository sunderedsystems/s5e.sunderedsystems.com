# Stress & Strain

**Powerful actions come with risks.**  
The further you push beyond your limits, the more challenging your actions become.

- **Stress:**  
  Any normal task attempted during combat is considered stressed.  
  For every missing Source Die, add +1 to the DC of stressed actions.

- **Strain:**  
  If you exceed your proficiency cap for SD spent in a round, the check becomes a **strained check**.  
  Strained DC: +1 for each SD already missing from your pool when you make the check.

See [Stress](/docs/stress) and [Strain](/docs/strain) for details.
