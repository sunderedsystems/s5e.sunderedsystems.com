# Stress

- Any normal task attempted during combat is considered **stressed**.
- For every missing Source Die, add **+1 to the DC** of stressed actions (combat, high-pressure, etc.).

> Some spells are also stressed.

> During Ascended Play (level 21+):  
> Stress/strain reduced to +1 DC per 2 missing SD (see Ascended Resilience).
