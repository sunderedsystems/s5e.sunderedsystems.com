# Summoner Replenishment

When you regain Source Dice through Replenishment, only the summoner regains Source Dice.

-Summons do not directly benefit from Replenishment.

-The summoner may freely allocate Source Dice from their own pool to their summons at any time, as long as they have sufficient SD to do so.

Example: You regain 6 SD from Replenishment. All 6 SD go to you. If you wish, you can immediately allocate some or all of those SD to your summons as needed.
