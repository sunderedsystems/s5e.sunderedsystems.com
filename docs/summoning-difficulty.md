# Summoning Difficulty

#### Single creature:
- DC = 30 + rank – (spellcasting ability + proficiency if proficient)
    - Example: Rank 6, Knowledge 14, no proficiency: DC 30 + 6 – 14 = 22

#### Multiple creatures:
- DC = 30 + highest rank + #creatures – (spellcasting ability + proficiency)

This represents the increasing mental and magical strain of controlling multiple forms simultaneously.
