# Summoning Limits and Source Commitment

- Max active summons = your total SD.
- Each creature is assigned SD when summoned; 
- While any summons are active, you do not suffer empty pool penalties.
- If summons uses its last SD, it is unsummoned.
- You cannot use Conversion (HP → SD) for yourself while summons are active, but can use it to replenish/increase a summon’s SD.

**Example:**  
With 7 SD, summon two creatures:
- 3 SD to one, 4 SD to another (both are now your total SD).
- You do not suffer empty pool penalties.
