# Sunder

Sunder is a critical technique with its own table. Sunder does not need to be known to spend from your CDB to apply it.

- Magical items may be sundered by higher-tier items (e.g., Mythic can sunder Legendary, etc.), but Mythic items cannot be sundered.
- Knowing Sunder as a technique lowers all damage thresholds by 1.
