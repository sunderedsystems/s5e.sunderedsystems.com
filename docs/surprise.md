# Surprise

If a creature or group is attempting to ambush or otherwise act unnoticed:

- Ambushers roll Agility (Stealth) vs. targetsâ€™ passive Knowledge (Perception).
    - Success = free round before normal turns begin.
    - If multiple targets are involved, the GM may determine success per creature or as a group threshold.
