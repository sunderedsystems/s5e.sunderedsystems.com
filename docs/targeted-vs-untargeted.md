# Targeted vs. Untargeted Disciplines

- “T” (Targeted): Only activates against another creature (e.g., Persuasion).
- “U” (Untargeted): Never targets a creature (e.g., History).
- “T/U”: Can be either, depending on situation (e.g., Brute force).

**Edge Cases:** GM may set the difficulty as untargeted if targeting a creature with a much higher relevant stat would make no narrative sense.

Like a Medicine check targeting a high Constitution, but narratively the difficulty should be low. 

-Example: Your character has 17 Knowledge and an Untargeted check to apply a bandage to a teammate (DC: 30-17=13) makes more sense than targeting your comrade's 18 in Constitution. 

This appropriately considers player investment in their ability scores, and better reflects the idea that someone proficient in Medicine will know how to apply a bandage.

Alternatively, making a Medicine check to poison someone's food according to their biometrics would correctly target Constitution (even if the target isn't currently present at the time of poisoning)
