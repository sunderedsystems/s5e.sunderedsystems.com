# Targeting

- To target a creature with an action, make a check against the target’s relevant ability score.

## How Targeting Works

- **DC = Target’s ability score**
- Roll d20 + your relevant modifier
- Add proficiency if you are proficient in the action or technique
- **Success = total ≥ target’s score**
