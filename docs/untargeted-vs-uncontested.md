# Untargeted vs. Uncontested

- **Untargeted:** World interaction—climbing, crafting, knowledge, healing.
- **Uncontested:** Targets a creature, but they’re willing or unaware.

## Examples

- Casting a healing/enhancement spell: DC = 30 minus your score.
- Friendly negotiation with a cooperative NPC: No roll if the outcome is already in your favor.

Example: A character with Influence 16 and proficiency in Coercion might not need to roll to convince a greedy host (Influence 14) to grant access to an "exclusive" restaurant if they offer money — the host is already inclined to comply.
