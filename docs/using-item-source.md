# Using Item Source

- Item Source may be used to fuel any player ability, spell, or technique as if it were part of the playerâ€™s own SD.
- However, item regeneration is tracked separately from replenishment.
- This makes magical items powerful strategic tools, enabling sustained actions, emergency surges, or bypassing player Source limits.
