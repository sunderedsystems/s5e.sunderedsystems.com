### The Fiend

**Dark one’s blessing**  
Once per round, when the warlock deals damage to a creature, they gain temporary hit points equal to their spellcasting modifier.

**Dark one’s luck**  
When the warlock makes an ability check they can expend 1 SD to add a d10 to the roll. They can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.

**Fiendish Resilience**  
The warlock can choose one damage type when they finish a short or long rest. They gain resistance to that damage type until they choose a different one with this feature.

**Hurl through hell**  
When the warlock hits a creature with an attack, they can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.

At the end of the warlock’s next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it gains disadvantage on all checks until it finishes a short or long rest. Once this feature is used, the warlock’s Source must be fully replenished before using this feature again.
