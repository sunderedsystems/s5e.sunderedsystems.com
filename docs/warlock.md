# Warlock

Classes define your unique strengths.

When multi-classing under level 20, players gain the core feature of a second class at level 10 in that class.

In Ascended play (beyond level 20) a character gains the core feature of any new class they take at level 20 in that class.

## Core Features

### Invocations

- Gain Invocation list as talents options.
- Proficiency determines highest invocation level you can gain/use (level capped by proficiency).


## Class Talents and Fighting Styles

- Start with 2 talents at level 1.
- Gain more talents equal to your proficiency each time proficiency increases.
- May reassign 2 talents each time proficiency increases (or every 5 levels after level 20)

## Fighting Styles

Any class may pick a Fighting Style instead of a class talent. You cannot take the same Fighting Style more than once.

**Options:**

- **Ranged:** Increase ranged weapon range by 10ft per proficiency.
- **Defense:** While wearing armor, decrease damage by proficiency an extra time.
- **Dueling:** One-handed weapon + empty offhand—add damage equal to SD spent on attack.
- **Great Weapon Fighting:** When rolling 1 or 2 on a damage die for a two-handed melee weapon, reroll (must use new roll). Weapon must be two-handed or versatile.
- **Protection:** If a creature within 5ft is attacked, you can block for them.
- **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When using two weapons, may use Sleight of Hand vs. Agility for your second attack; on success, disarm or make the target drop an item.

## Talents 

### The Fiend

**Dark one’s blessing**  
When the warlock deals an instance of damage (single target or Area of Effect), they gain temporary hit points equal to their proficiency.

**Dark one’s luck**  
When the warlock makes an ability check they can expend 2 SD to add their spellcasting modifier to the roll. They can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.

**Fiendish Resilience**  
The warlock can choose one damage type when they finish a short or long rest. They gain resistance to that damage type until they choose a different one with this feature.

**Hurl through hell**  
When the warlock hits a creature with an attack, they can spend 2SD to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.

At the end of the warlock’s next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, the DC of their next check is increased by the Warlock's Proficiency.
