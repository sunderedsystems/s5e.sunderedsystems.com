# Weapons

- Weapons require minimum ability scores. If unmet, add the difference to the attackâ€™s DC.

Example:  
If requirement is +2, but you have +0, attack DC increases by +2.

## Weapon Requirements

| Weapon Type     | Min Strength | Min Agility |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1H Melee/Shield | +1           | +1          |
| 2H Weapon       | +2           | +1          |
| Ranged          | +1           | +2          |
