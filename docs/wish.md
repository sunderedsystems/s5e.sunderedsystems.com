# Wish

Wish is a spell apart. While other spells mold reality within its laws, Wish is the law by which reality was made. The consequences of such power are often far-reaching and unseen. To rewrite the world by which you exist is to rewrite some part of yourself.

When a being’s wish is granted, they roll a d6 and take a permanent –1 penalty to the corresponding ability score:  
1 – Agility  
2 – Constitution  
3 – Strength  
4 – Wisdom  
5 – Knowledge  
6 – Influence

This is the known toll of wielding godlike power — a price even the divine must pay. Among the gods, it is said:  
"Mortal beings, mortal consequences. Immortal beings, immortal consequences."

**Scope:**  
The most effective Wish targets a single present-tense truth: a fact of reality here and now.  
* Wishing to change the past can cause catastrophic paradoxes.  
* Wishing for a future outcome risks failure as its parameters may be unmet. This method of wishing can result in a future explosion of chaotic magic or a loss of ability at an unfortunate moment.

However, as it is a sacred right of all beings to wish, and of the powerful to make their wishes real, no force, not even a god, may prevent or counter the casting of Wish.

**Failure:** If the Wish fails, the caster loses the committed Source and must roll on the Surge Table for a chaotic magical effect, but does not suffer a -1 to an ability score.  
**Success:** If the Wish succeeds, the caster suffers the permanent loss to one ability score, as detailed above.

**Note:** Gods may grant wishes to others without suffering the toll themselves — the cost is drawn from the Wisher. Many gods have amassed immense power this way, shaping reality through mortal longing. Worshipers desire nothing above a powerful deity.

**Target:** Untargeted, stressed  
**Effect:** Reshape reality in line with a specific wish. For each additional effect beyond the first, increase the difficulty by +1.
