# Wizard

---

### In Arcanum
The wizard has a spellbook that counts as a focus from which they cast spells. It must be within 10ft of them and occupy the same dimension to use it. It is immune to non-magical damage. If it is magically destroyed, the wizard knows a ritual by which they can create a new spellbook. The ritual takes 1 hour for each spell (excluding cantrips) the book contains, and may be completed in sessions. The wizard may not cast a spell that is not in the spellbook (excluding cantrips).

### By Rote
The wizard gains three cantrips of their choice that don’t count against their known techniques.

---

### By Rite
The wizard can cast ritual spells from their spell book. These spells do not count against the wizard's known techniques.

---

### By Tradition
Choose one - Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. Spells from the chosen school do not count against the wizard's known techniques.

---

### By Will
The wizard knows a number of spells equal to their proficiency that can be cast without the spellbook. These spells do not count against their known abilities. The wizard may change these at any time through the “learning spells” mechanic.

### By Sculp
When casting an area spell, the wizard may choose a number of creatures equal to their proficiency to exclude from the effect. Additionally, if they are targeting a group of enemies with varying ability scores, the wizard may choose to exclude creatures with the highest relevant ability score. If the wizard does so, the spell only affects creatures whose associated ability score is equal to or lower than the chosen threshold. This may allow the wizard to successfully target more vulnerable members of a group instead of failing to affect the group as a whole.

### By Channel
The wizard may assign max damage on a spell by taking half the damage in turn. This damage cannot be avoided or mitigated. The spell still requires expending SD equal to the level it is cast, and cannot exceed the proficiency cap.
