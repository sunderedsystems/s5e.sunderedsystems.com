# Wizard

Classes define your unique strengths.

When multi-classing under level 20, players gain the core feature of a second class at level 10 in that class.

In Ascended play (beyond level 20) a character gains the core feature of any new class they take at level 20 in that class.

## Core Features

### Wizardoir

- Gains an extra SD every wizard level (max 20). May only be spent on spells. Replenishes simultaneously with Source.

## Class Talents and Fighting Styles

- Start with 2 talents at level 1.
- Gain more talents equal to your proficiency each time proficiency increases.
- May reassign 2 talents each time proficiency increases (or every 5 levels after level 20)

## Fighting Styles

Any class may pick a Fighting Style instead of a class talent. You cannot take the same Fighting Style more than once.

**Options:**

- **Ranged:** Increase ranged weapon range by 10ft per proficiency.
- **Defense:** While wearing armor, decrease damage by proficiency an extra time.
- **Dueling:** One-handed weapon + empty offhand—add damage equal to SD spent on attack.
- **Great Weapon Fighting:** When rolling 1 or 2 on a damage die for a two-handed melee weapon, reroll (must use new roll). Weapon must be two-handed or versatile.
- **Protection:** If a creature within 5ft is attacked, you can block for them.
- **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When using two weapons, may use Sleight of Hand vs. Agility for your second attack; on success, disarm or make the target drop an item.

## Talents 


### In Arcanum
The wizard has a spellbook that counts as a focus from which they cast spells. It must be within 10ft of them and occupy the same dimension to use it. It is immune to non-magical damage. If it is magically destroyed, the wizard knows a ritual by which they can create a new spellbook. The ritual takes 1 hour for each spell (excluding cantrips) the book contains, and may be completed in sessions. The wizard may not cast a spell that is not in the spellbook (excluding cantrips).

---

### By Rote
The wizard gains three cantrips of their choice that don’t count against their known techniques.

---

### By Rite
The wizard can cast ritual spells from their spell book. These spells do not count against the wizard's known techniques.

---

### By Tradition
Choose one - Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. Spells from the chosen school do not count against the wizard's known techniques.

---

### By Will
The wizard knows a number of spells equal to their proficiency that can be cast without the spellbook. These spells do not count against their known abilities. The wizard may change these at any time through the “learning spells” mechanic.

---

### By Sculp
When casting an area spell, the wizard may choose a number of creatures equal to their proficiency to exclude from the effect. Additionally, if they are targeting a group of enemies with varying ability scores, the wizard may choose to exclude creatures with the highest relevant ability score. If the wizard does so, the spell only affects creatures whose associated ability score is equal to or lower than the chosen threshold. This may allow the wizard to successfully target more vulnerable members of a group instead of failing to affect the group as a whole.

---

### By Channel
The wizard may assign max damage on a spell by taking half the damage in turn. This damage cannot be avoided or mitigated. The spell still requires expending SD equal to the level it is cast, and cannot exceed the proficiency cap.
